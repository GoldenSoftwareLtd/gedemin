DeleteProp readme file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some times you need to delete one or more properties from Delphi DFM files.
Not an easy task if your project consists of hundreds of them.

This utility allows you to do such work fast and easy. Just specify folder name, check
whether you want to process subfolders, and enter list of properties to be removed.
Then, click Start button.

For every changed file utility will create backup copy in the same folder.

This utility is especially useful when migrating from one
Delphi version to another and when installing newer version of
some components bunch.
