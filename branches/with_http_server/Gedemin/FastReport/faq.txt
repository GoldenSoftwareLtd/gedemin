+=============================================================================+

1.1. FR does not prints correctly on my printer.

(variants: exception when selecting a printer; printer skips some pages;
some chars are turned on 90 degrees; the printout is messed up and etc.)
(problem is known with printers: Xerox, Canon and HP).

Try to uncomment the {$DEFINE PRN_RESET} line in the FR_Prntr.pas file,
recompile the FR package and your application. In most cases problem is gone.
If problem is still exists, try to install the newest printer driver or driver
from the similar printer model.


===============================================================================
1.2. Can't set the user-defined paper size.

(The dialog "Page options" in the designer, the paper width and height edit
boxes always disabled).

FR uses only papers supported by the printer driver. If the driver reports
that it can support the user paper (paper number 0x100h in the WinAPI), FR
allows these edit boxes when user selects the "user-defined paper".
Some drivers use another paper number for the user-defined paper - FR can't
works in such cases.


===============================================================================
1.3. FR objects don't shift when I change the left margin.

The left and right margins affects only to Cross-tab reports. But you can set
the BandAlign property of text objects to baLeft and that objects will slick
to the left margin automatically.


===============================================================================
1.4. Export filters (word, html, text) work ugly.

(text is shifted, empty lines and so on)
What you want? :) FR coordinates measured in the pixels; MSWord, html, txt has
line-oriented data representation. When exporting to such formats, FR
inevitably distorts the layout. Try to play with X and Y factors in the export
options.

(some objects are not exported, for example, Rich)
Try other export filter (for example, one from the powerpack). There are also
commercial export filters from the Pragnaan Software (link is in my site).


===============================================================================
1.5. All captions and hints in the FR dialogs are wrong.

a) wrong language resources are installed. To install correct resources, go
FR\RES\your_resource and run the mk.bat file. Rebuild the FR package and your
application.
b) resources conflicts with other third-party library. FR uses the range
53000..59000. Change the frRes constant in the file FR_Const.pas and
recompile the FR.


===============================================================================
1.6. When installing FR, Delphi asks for some packages that I don't have.

(for example, Delphi wants IBO40CRT, TEE45, RXCTL6, mwEdit_D6 and so on)

The file FRx.dpk (x - Delphi version) referenced such packages. But references
are in {$IFDEF} directives. Reference is used if you uncommented appropriate
line in the FR.inc file.
When installing FR, Delphi may asks you to save changes in the .dpk file. If
you say "Yes", Delphi removes all {$IFDEF} directives and you'll get such error.
Get an original dpk file, install FR again and don't save changes in this file.


===============================================================================
1.7. FR Object Inspector disappeared, can't get it back.

ATTENTION! You may corrupt the Windows if you don't have an experience!
Run the Windows registry editor (regedit.exe), open the key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\FastReport\name_of_your_project\Form\TfrInspForm
and check and correct if need the XPosition, YPosition, Width, Height values.


===============================================================================
1.8. The SUM function works incorrect.

(in the report with two masterdata bands can't get sum the second band)

FR can't determine which band to sum. Use the extended SUM syntax (also for MIN,
MAX, AVG):
SUM([CustNo], MasterData2)


===============================================================================
1.9. Problems with Delphi's Translation Tool.

(error "Resource TfrProgressForm not found" when running a project that
uses FR)

Include all FR files in the uses list. Or compile your project with run-time
packages.


===============================================================================
1.10. Access to the internal datasets from the script doesn't works.

(I write: frDialogForm.Query1.Open)

Write without "frDialogForm":
Query1.Open


===============================================================================
1.11. The TOTALPAGES variable always returns 0.

The report must be two-pass (go File|Report options in the designer).


===============================================================================
1.12. Error when assigning a string value to the FR variable.
(code like frReport1.Dictionary.Variables['Range'] := '10..50')

FR trying to calc such string values. Add quotes:

frReport1.Dictionary.Variables['Range'] := '''' + '10..50' + '''';

or use frVariables for static data.


===============================================================================
1.13. FR designer shows "Untitled" in the caption.

(I store the report in the BLOb. When I load the report and run the designer,
it shows "Untitled" in the caption)

Before run the designer, do this:
frReport1.FileName := 'MyReport';


===============================================================================
1.14. FR2.4 can't open the frf files created in the previous version.

(FreeReport .frf files can't be opened with FR2.4)

Change the first byte in the report file to 16h and do the following
modifications in source code. After these modifications, load the report and
save it. Finally, return back the original code.

FR_Class:

function ReadString(Stream: TStream): String;
begin
{  if frVersion >= 23 then}
    Result := frReadString(Stream) {else
    Result := frReadString22(Stream);}
end;

procedure ReadMemo(Stream: TStream; Memo: TStrings);
begin
{  if frVersion >= 23 then}
    frReadMemo(Stream, Memo){ else
    frReadMemo22(Stream, Memo);}
end;


FR_Utils:

procedure frReadMemo(Stream: TStream; l: TStrings);
var
  s: String;
  b: Byte;
  n: Word;
begin
  l.Clear;
  l.Text := frReadString(Stream); exit;
  Stream.Read(n, 2);
  if n > 0 then
    repeat
      Stream.Read(n, 2);
      SetLength(s, n);
      Stream.Read(s[1], n);
      l.Add(s);
      Stream.Read(b, 1);
    until b = 0
  else
    Stream.Read(b, 1);
end;

function frReadString(Stream: TStream): String;
var
  s: String;
  n: Integer;
  b: Byte;
begin
  Stream.Read(n, 4);
  SetLength(s, n);
  Stream.Read(s[1], n);
  if (n > 0) and (s[n] = #$0A) then
    SetLength(s, n - 2);
//  Stream.Read(b, 1);
  Result := s;
end;


===============================================================================
1.15. Printout is little differs from the preview screen.

FR2.4 has not full WYSIWYG. Wait for FR3.0.

+=============================================================================+

2.1. How to make some report?

Better ask this in the FR mailing list (forum). With FR you can build almost
all types of reports, but you must read the documentation first.


===============================================================================
2.2. Can FR work with some library?

FR works with all DB access components that are based on TDataSet. Besides,
FR can works with IB_Objects, that is incompatible with TDataSet.


===============================================================================
2.3. What is "script"?

This is a piece of code written in the Pascal-like language. FR can run such
code - it gives you ability to change the report's behavior during the
building process. See the documentation for details.

(does a band have a script?)
Yes, it does - select the band and select "OnBeforePrint" property in the 
FR Object Inspector (or press Ctrl+Enter).


(does a page have a script?)
Yes, it does. Click on empty space of the page and select "OnBeforePrint"
(OnActivate if the page is the dialog form) property in the FR Object Inspector.  


(can I access objects from the script?)
Yes, you can - use full name of the object:
Memo1.Font.Name


(what properties can be accessed?)
Complete list of properties is in the documentation. 


(I have two objects on a band, which script will run first?)
Object that you've created first will run first (that called Z-Order).
Preferred way is to write a script in the band.


===============================================================================
2.4. How to show the Summary band at the bottom of the page?

Look at the "Summary at the bottom" report in the demo FR\DEMOS\REPORTS


===============================================================================
2.5. How to print the group total in the group header?

Look at the "Group totals in header" report in the demo FR\DEMOS\REPORTS


===============================================================================
2.6. I want to keep a group together.

Look at the "Keep group together" report in the demo FR\DEMOS\REPORTS


===============================================================================
2.7. I want to keep a MasterFooter together with MasterData.

Write this in the MasterData script:

begin
  if FreeSpace < MasterFooter1.Height then
    NewPage;
end


===============================================================================
2.8. How to change the TabOrder of the dialog controls?

a) use Bring to front/Send to back toolbar buttons.
b) install the TabOrder wizard from the powerpack.


===============================================================================
2.9. How to change the language in the FR dialogs on-the-fly?

a) use resources in a DLL. Compile the resource DLL (run mkdll.bat file from
the FR\RES\your_resource folder) and write in your program:

frLocale.LoadDll('FR_ENGL.DLL');

If you want to use default resources, write:

frLocale.UnloadDll;


b) resources in the text file or ini file or in other form. Use the event
frLocale.OnLocalize. It puts StringID and gets ResultString. For example:

frLocale.OnLocalize := MyClass.OnLocalize;

procedure TMyClass.OnLocalize(StringID: Integer; var ResultString: String);
begin
  if StringID = 53000 then
    ResultString := 'Search';
end;


===============================================================================
2.10. Can I run the FR designer as a MDI Child?

You can't - try to change the FR sources.


===============================================================================
2.11. How to work with TfrUserDataset?

(I want to print data from array/stringgrid/etc)

Look at demo FR\DEMOS\PRNGRID.


===============================================================================
2.12. Can I print the A3 report on two A4 papers?

No, you can't.


===============================================================================
2.13. How to print on Dot Matrix Printers?

If you want fast printing - export your report to txt and then print it:

frReport1.PrepareReport;
frReport1.ExportTo(frTextExport1, 'prn');


===============================================================================
2.14. How to make particular object non-printable, but visible in the preview?

Wait for FR3.0. 


===============================================================================
2.15. FR prints multi-page reports in the order 1,1,2,2. How to change it to 1,2,1,2?

If report has several pages, FR prints all records in the page1 and then all
records in the page2. If you want to change it, set the TfrReport.DataSet
property to main dataset and set the TfrReport.ReportType = rtMultiple.


===============================================================================
2.16. Can I assign other paper bin for the first page of the report?

If your report template has two or more pages, you can set individual paper bin
to each page. But if your report has one page (one page in the designer, I mean)
you can't change the paper bin of the first page in the prepared report.


===============================================================================
2.17. How to fax/email the prepared report?

a) faxing: install the fax software. It adds the "Fax" printer to your printer
list. Just select this printer in FR and print on it.
b) emailing: export the prepared report to one of the formats
(frp,txt,html,rtf etc) and send it as attachment (you may use WinAPI function
to send an email).


===============================================================================
2.18. How to change a query parameter from the script?

(may I write something like Query1.Params[0].Text := '10'?)

No, FR can't access query parameters. But you can assign a variable to the
parameter (in the parameters editor) and change this variable:

Query1.Close;
MyParam1 := '10';
Query1.Open;


===============================================================================
2.19. How to disable some report pages?

Add an empty dialog form to the report and write this in its OnActivate event:

begin
  Page2.Visible := False 
end


===============================================================================
2.20. How to determine that report was builded succesfully?

if frReport1.PrepareReport then // successfull, show it
  frReport1.ShowPreparedReport


===============================================================================
2.21. How to hide some buttons in the designer?

There are some things in the FR_Desgn.pas:

type
  TfrDesignerRestriction =
    (frdrDontEditObj, frdrDontModifyObj, frdrDontSizeObj, frdrDontMoveObj,
     frdrDontDeleteObj, frdrDontCreateObj,
     frdrDontDeletePage, frdrDontCreatePage, frdrDontEditPage,
     frdrDontCreateReport, frdrDontLoadReport, frdrDontSaveReport,
     frdrDontPreviewReport, frdrDontEditVariables, frdrDontChangeReportOptions);
  TfrDesignerRestrictions = set of TfrDesignerRestriction;

var
  DesignerRestrictions: TfrDesignerRestrictions;

Assign some flags to the DesignerRestrictions and call the designer.


===============================================================================
2.22. How to use own function?

Use TfrReport.OnUserFunction event. Here is simple example:

procedure TForm1.frReport1UserFunction(const Name: String;
  p1, p2, p3: Variant; var val: Variant);
begin
  if AnsiCompareText('SUMTOSTR', Name) = 0 then
    val := My_Convertion_Routine(frParser.Calc(p1));
end;

After this, you can use SumToStr function in any place of report
(in any expression or script).


(ok, but it works only for one TfrReport component. I want to use
my function everywhere (in all TfrReport components).

Make OnUserFunction event handler common for all components. If you can't do
this, you should create the function library:

type
  TMyFunctionLibrary = class(TfrFunctionLibrary)
  public
    constructor Create; override;
    procedure DoFunction(FNo: Integer; p1, p2, p3: Variant;
      var val: Variant); override;
  end;

constructor TMyFunctionLibrary.Create;
begin
  inherited Create;
  with List do
  begin
    Add('DATEPROPIS');
    Add('SUMPROPIS');
  end;
end;

procedure TMyFunctionLibrary.DoFunction(FNo: Integer; p1, p2, p3: Variant;
  var val: Variant);
begin
  val := 0;
  case FNo of
    0: val := My_DateConvertion_Routine(frParser.Calc(p1));
    1: val := My_SumConvertion_Routine(frParser.Calc(p1));
  end;
end;

To register function library, call
frRegisterFunctionLibrary(TMyFunctionLibrary);
To unregister library, call
frUnRegisterFunctionLibrary(TMyFunctionLibrary);


(how I can add my function to function list (in expression builder)?

Use frAddFunctionDesc procedure (FR_Class unit):

frAddFunctionDesc(FuncLib, 'SUMTOSTR', 'My functions',
  'SUMTOSTR(<Number>)/Converts number to its verbal presentation.');

Note: "/" symbol is required! It separates the function syntax from its
description.
FuncLib is reference to your function library (can be nil if you don't use
the function library). When function library is unregistered, all its
function will be automatically removed from the function list.


===============================================================================
2.23. How to fill the data dictionary programmatically?

All variables and categories from data dictionary stored in
TfrReport.Dictionary.Variables.

with frReport1.Dictionary do
begin
  // creating category (space in category name required!)
  Variables[' New category'] := '';
  // creating variables
  Variables['New Variable'] := 'CustomerData.Customers."CustNo"';
  Variables['Another Variable'] := 'Page#';
end;


===============================================================================
2.24. I don't want to show some datasets in the data dictionary and in the report.

Use TfrReport.Dictionary.DisabledDatasets:

with frReport1.Dictionary do
begin
  // turn of this dataset
  DisabledDatasets.Add('CustomerData.Bio');
  // or, turn off entire datamodule/form
  DisabledDatasets.Add('CustomerData*');
end;


===============================================================================
2.25. How to pass a value to the report?

There are several methods to do this. First is to use global object
frVariables (defined in FR_Class unit):

frVariables['My variable'] := 10;

This code creates a new variable with 'My variable' name and value = 10.
This method is best to pass static data to the report.

Second method is to use the TfrReport.OnGetValue event. You can use this
method to pass dynamic data, i.e. data that changes from record to record.

procedure TForm1.frReport1GetValue(ParName: String; var ParValue: Variant);
begin
  if ParName = 'MyField' then
    ParValue := Table1MyField.Value;
end;

Finally, third method is to define variable from dictionary programmatically:

with frReport1.Dictionary do
begin
  Variables['MyVariable'] := 'CustomerData.Customers."CustNo"';
  Variables['Another Variable'] := '10';
end;


(can I pass data from report to the program?)

Use frVariables object. If you write the following code in any script:

MyVariable := 10

then in your program you can use this code to retrieve MyVariable value:
v := frVariables['MyVariable'];


===============================================================================
2.26. How to make the TChart with several series?

You can't do this in designer. You need to write some code in Delphi.
Create TChart or TDBChart, fill it out; put the empty TfrChartView to the report;
write the following code in the TfrReport.OnBeforePrint event handler:

if View.Name = 'Chart1' then
  TfrChartView(View).AssignChart(your_Delphi_chart)


===============================================================================
2.27. How to switch pages in the designer?

Just drag the page tab on a new place.


===============================================================================
2.28. I want to show variables and data fields in one insert dialog.

Set the TfrReport.MixVariablesAndDBFields := True. All data fields and
variables now accessible in the "Insert data field" dialog.


===============================================================================
2.29. How to hide "export options" dialog?

Set all necessary properties of the export component (TfrTextExport, for example)
and disable the dialog by setting ShowDialog property to False.


===============================================================================
2.30. I store my reports in a BLOb. How to change the "Open/Save" dialogs in the designer?

Look at TfrDesigner component. It has necessary events: OnLoadReport and
OnSaveReport. Here is a small example:

procedure TForm1.frDesigner1LoadReport(Report: TfrReport;
  var ReportName: String; var Opened: Boolean);
begin
  with MyOpenDialog do
  begin
    Opened := ShowModal = mrOk;
    if Opened then
    begin
      Report.LoadFromBlobField(...);
      ReportName := ...;
    end;
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.frDesigner1SaveReport(Report: TfrReport;
  var ReportName: String; SaveAs: Boolean; var Saved: Boolean);
begin
  if SaveAs then
    with MySaveDialog do
    begin
      Saved := ShowModal = mrOk;
      if Saved then
      begin
        Report.SaveToBlobField(...);
        ReportName := ...;
      end;
    end
  else
    Report.SaveToBlobField(...);
end;


===============================================================================
2.31. How to access to the report object from Delphi?

FR objects is not a components and can be accessed this way:

var
  t: TfrMemoView;
begin
  t := TfrMemoView(frReport1.FindObject('Memo1'));

  if t <> nil then
    t.Memo.Text := 'FastReport';
// or this:
  if t <> nil then
    t.Prop['Memo'] := 'FastReport';
end;


===============================================================================
2.32. How to define own hotkeys in the TfrPreview?

TfrPreview component has a property Window: TForm. You can assign your event
handler to the TfrPreview.Window.OnKeyDown.


===============================================================================
2.33. How to print a report without previewing it?  

This way:

if frReport1.PrepareReport then
  frReport1.PrintPreparedReport('', 1, True, frAll);
  // or
  frReport1.PrintPreparedReportDlg;


===============================================================================
2.34. How to print a picture that stored in a file?

a) use TfrReport.OnBeforePrint event:

if View.Name = 'Picture1' then
  TfrPictureView(View).Picture.LoadFromFile(...) or
                              .Assign or
                              .everything_what_you_want

b) in the script:

begin
  Picture1.LoadFromFile(filename)
end
