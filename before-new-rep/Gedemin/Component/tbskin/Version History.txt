various minor fixes & tweaks ..

Added/Fixed/Changed in TBSkin+ Patch 1.00 Beta 2:
--
1) Component Behavior Change.
    A) To use the Original TB2k Code you must:
         Not put any TTBSkin component on you form or
         if you have it must be set to "SkinType = tbsDisabled".

    B) To use a skin to any toolbars without assign it you must:
         Put a TTBSkin on your form, (make it default if there's more
         TTBSkins) and choose the skin you like.In other words, 
         if you don't assign any TTBSkin, the Toolbar/Popup will use
         the "DefaultSkin". If there isn't any Default Skin the Toolbar
         will not execute any "Skin/Patch" code. (like setting default 
         or assigned skin to tbsDisabled).

2) Major optimizations to the patch code (I think it's faster now)

       when they dropped

//Skin Patch, //Skin Patch Begin,  //Skin Patch End,  //Skin Patch Remove
15) Documents updated 
16) Removed the functions: (Typecastings is easier)
    TBSSkinTypeToString,  TBSColorSetToString,
    TBSStringToSkinType, TBSStringColorSet

    A) Allows for multple skins on a form, one being the default.

         appropriate TTBSkin.
    D) Added TBSkinManager for multiple skins.  Invisble helper class, really.
    E) Minor tweaks to non-painting code.

Note! This mean you must assign a TTBSkin to every TTBToolbar and/or TTBPopup.
If a TTBSkin presented and it's DefaultSkin, the Toolbars which haven't any
assigned "Skin" it will use the "Default or First" TTBSkin available.

    TBSSkinTypeToString,  TBSColorSetToString,
    TBSStringToSkinType, TBSStringColorSet

4) Added WindowsXP Skin Type. 
5) Color Properties are completed changed so if you have any Custom
    colorset you should BACKUP the color values first. (Send to me any 
    good custom colorset you've made to include it into the next release)
6) Re-implement Dock Drag drawing algorithm for OfficeXP skin.
     It's now extact to Office XP. (7 lines on menus and 8 for toolbars)
     It's also now transparent when toolbar are using Background.
7) OfficeXP Skin: more accurate colors & rounded toolbars added
8) Vertically Docked Captions (From From Dean Harmon). 
     Enabling this option will replace the "Drag Handle" with the Toolbar caption.
