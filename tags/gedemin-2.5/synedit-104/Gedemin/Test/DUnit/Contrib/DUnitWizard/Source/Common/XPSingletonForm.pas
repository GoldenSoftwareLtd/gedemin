 TXPSingletonForm:

 Implementation of the Singleton concept for TForm descendants.
 All co-existent constructions of a (particular) descendant form type
 will be references to a unique instance of that form type, rather than
 separate instances.

 Notes:
 This implementation is not thread-safe, but that is not considered an issue
 since all forms will most probably be created in the context of the
 main/VCL/primary thread, ie directly, or serialized in the VCL thread via
 TThread.Synchronise() calls.
  This is basically a set'n'forget class. Create() (and Free() if Ownerless)
 all instances of any descendant of this class as you would normally.
 The only caveat is:
 If you implement constructors and/or destructors in your subclass, reference
 the <IsSoleRef> protected property declared in this class. See notes above
 <IsSoleRef> declaration for details.
