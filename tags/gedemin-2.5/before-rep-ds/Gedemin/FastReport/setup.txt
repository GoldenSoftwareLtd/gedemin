   Before installing, remove any other version of FastReport from the Delphi
component palette. 

   FR2.5 includes full source code. Trial version contains almost all sources
(only one compiled unit). Before installing, you should copy this unit
from ..\FR\LIB_DX to ..\FR\SOURCE.

3.1. Delphi 2.0
   Copy file FR_Class.dcu from ..\FR\LIB_D2 to ..\FR\SOURCE (if you evaluating
FR). 
   If you have TChart or TeeChartPro open the file \fr250\source\FR.inc
with any text editor and uncomment the required string, then save the file -
this will allow the TfrChart component to be installed.
   Now open Delphi 2 and select close all from the file menu this will close
the default starting project. Select Install from the component menu select
add the select browse in the dialog box select the source folder under the
folder to which you installed FastReport then select FR_REG.PAS file, click
Ok, when you return to the install dialog window click Ok again and your
library should recompile.
   If you have any problems see installing components in your Delphi Manual.
Note: You should make a backup copy of the Delphi CMPLIB32.DCL AND SAVE IT
IN A DIFFERENT FOLDER - THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO REPLACE YOUR LIBRARY IF IT
FAILS TO COMPILE .

3.10. Installing additional components.
   There are three additional components included in standard FR package.
These components can be found in SOURCE\BDE, SOURCE\IBX and SOURCE\ADO
folders. They supersede old datamanager (TfrDataStorage component). To
install them, use same technique as described above. Each component have
a package file. To install in Delphi2, use file with Reg suffix (for example,
FR_BDEReg.pas).
   WARNING! The old datamanager (TfrDataStorage) is outdated. It included in
this FR version, but will be removed in the next version. We highly 
recommended to stop using it, move to new components and convert your existing
reports.
