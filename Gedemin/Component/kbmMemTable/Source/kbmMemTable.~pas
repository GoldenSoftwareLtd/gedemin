//
// History:
//
//1.00:	The first release. Was created due to a need for a component like this.
//                                                                    (15. Jan. 99)
//1.01:	The first update. Release 1.00 contained some bugs related to the ordering
//	    of records inserted and to bookmarks. Problems fixed.         (21. Jan. 99)

//1.02:	Fixed handling of NULL values. Added SaveToStream, SaveToFile,
//	    LoadFromStream and LoadFromFile. SaveToStream and SaveToFile is controlled
//	    by a flag telling if to save data, contents of calculated fields,
//	    contents of lookupfields and contents of non visible fields.
//	    Added an example application with Delphi 3 source code.       (26. Jan. 99)
//
//1.03: Claude Rieth from Computer Team sarl (clrieth@team.lu) came up with an
//      implementation of CommaText and made a validation check in _InternalInsert.
//      Because I allready have implemented the saveto.... functions, I decided
//      to implement Claude's idea using my own saveto.... functions. (27. Jan. 99)
//      I have decided to rename the component, because Claude let me know that
//      the RX library have a component with the same name as this.
//      Thus in the future the component will be named TkbmMemTable.
//      SaveToStream and LoadFromStream now set up date and decimal separator
//      temporary to make sure that the data saved can be loaded on another
//      installation with different date and decimal separator setups.
//      Added EmptyTable method to clear the contents of the memory table.
//
//1.04: Wagner ADP (wagner@cads-informatica.com.br) found a bug in the _internalinsert
//      procedure which he came up with a fix for.                     (4. Feb. 99)
//      Added support for the TDataset protected function findrecord.
//      Added support for CreateTable, DeleteTable.
//
//1.05: Charlie McKeegan from Task Software Limited (charlie@task.co.uk) found
//      a minor bug (and came up with a fix) in SetRecNo which mostly is
//      noticeable in a grid where the grid wont refresh when the record slider
//      is moved to the end of the recordset.                          (5. Feb. 99)
//      Changed SaveToStream to use the displayname of the field as the header
//      instead of the fieldname.
//
//1.06: Introduced a persistence switch and a reference to a file. If the
//      persistence switch is set, the file will be read aut. on table open,
//      and the contents of the table will be saved in the table on table close.
//
//1.07: Changed calculation of fieldofsets in InternalOpen to follow the fielddefs
//      instead of fields. It has importance when rearranging fields.
//      Because of this change the calculation of fieldoffsets into the buffer
//      has been changed too. These corrections was found to be needed to
//      support the new components tkbmPooledQuery and tkbmPooledStoredProc
//      (found in the package tkbmPooledConn)
//      which in turn handles pooled connections to a database. Very usefull
//      in f.ex a WWW application as they also makes the BDE function threadsafe,
//      and limits the concurrent connections to a database.
//
//1.08: Changed buffer algorithm in GetLine since the old one was faulty.
//      Problem was pointed out by: Markus Roessler@gmx.de
//
//1.09: Added LoadFromDataset, SaveToDataset, CreateTableAs,
//      BCD and BLOB support by me.
//      James Baile (James@orchiddata.demon.co.uk) pointed out a bug in GetRecNo
//      which could lead to an endless loop in cases with filtering. He also
//      provided code for sorting, which I have been rearranging a bit and
//      implemented.
//      Travis Diamond (tdiamond@airmail.net) pointed out a bug in GetWord where
//      null fields would be skipped.
//      Claudio Driussi (c.driussi@popmail.iol.it) send me version including
//      a sort routine, and Ive used some of he's ideas to implement a sorting
//      mechanism. Further he's code contained MoveRecords and MoveCurRec which
//      I decided to include in a modified form for Drag and Drop record
//      rearrangements.
//
//1.10: Support for Locate.                                             (17. May. 99)
//      Claudio Driussi (c.driussi@popmail.iol.it) came up with a fix for
//      GetRecNo. MoveRecord is now public.
//      Andrius Adamonis (andrius@prototechnika.lt) came up with fix for
//      call to validation routines in SetFieldData and support for
//      OldValue and NewValue in GetActiveRecordBuffer.
//
//1.11: Pascalis Bochoridis from SATO S.A Greece (pbohor@sato.gr)
//      Corrected bookmark behavior (substituted RecordNo from TRecInfo with unused Bookmark)
//      Corrected GetRecNo & SetRecNo  (Scrollbars now work ok at First and Last record)
//      Added LocateRecord, Locate, Lookup (I decided to use his Locate instead of my own).
//
//1.12: Added CloseBlob. Corrected destructor.                          (26. May. 99)
//      Corrected GetFieldData and SetFieldData. Could Result in overwritten
//      memory elsewhere because of use of DataSize instead of Size.
//      Pascalis Bochoridis from SATO S.A Greece (phohor@sato.gr) send me a corrected
//      LocateRecord which solves problems regarding multiple keyfields.
//      Thomas Bogenrieder (tbogenrieder@wuerzburg.netsurf.de) have suggested a faster
//      LoadFromStream version which is much faster, but loads the full stream contents into
//      memory before processing. I fixed a few bugs in it, rearranged it and decided
//      to leave it up to you what you want to use.
//      I suggest that if you need speed for smaller streams, use his method, else use mine.
//      You c an activate his method by uncommenting the define statement FAST_LOADFROMSTREAM
//      a few lines down.
//
//1.13  Corrected SetRecNo and MoveRecord.                               (31. May. 99)
//      By Pascalis Bochoridis from SATO S.A Greece (phohor@sato.gr)
//
//1.14  Respecting DefaultFields differently.                            (3. Jun. 99)
//      LoadFromDataset now includes a CopyStructure flag.
//      Supporting Master/Detail relations.
//      Now the Sort uses a new property for determining the fields to sort on,
//      which means its possible to sort on other fields than is used for
//      master/detail. Added SortOn(FieldNames:string) which is used for quick
//      addhoc sorting by just supplying the fieldnames as parameters to the
//      SortOn command.
//      Fixed memory leak in LoadFromDataset (forgot to free bookmark).
//      Added CopyFieldProperties parameter to LoadFromDataset and CreateTableAs which
//      if set to TRUE will copy f.ex. DisplayName, DisplayFormat, EditMask etc. from
//      the source.
//      Corrected OnValidate in SetFieldData. Was placed to late to have any impact.
//      Now checking for read only fields in SetFieldData.
//
//1.15  Totally rearranged LocateRecord to handle binary search when     (23. Jun. 99)
//      the data searched is sorted.
//      I was inspired by Paulo Conzon (paolo.conzon@smc.it) who send me a version with the Locate method
//      hacked for binary search. New methods PopulateRecord and PopulateField is used to create
//      a key record to search for.
//      Changed Sort and SortOn to accept sortoptions by a parameter instead of having a property.
//      The following sort options exists: mtsoCaseInsensitive and mtsoDescending.
//      mtsoPartialKey is used internally from LocateRecord where the TLocateOptions are remapped to
//      TkbmMemTableCompareOptions.
//
//1.16  Bug fixed in SaveToDataset. Close called where it shouldnt.      (19. Jul. 99)
//      Bug reported by Reinhard Kalinke (R_Kalinke@compuserve.com)
//      Fixed a few bugs + introduced Blob saving/loading in LoadFromStream/SaveToStream and thus
//      also LoadFromFile/SaveToFile. To save blob fields specify mtfSaveBlobs in save flags.
//      Full AutoInc implementation (max. 1 autoinc field/table).
//      These fixes and enhancements was contributed by Arséne von Wys (arsene@vonwyss.ch)
//      SetFieldData triggered the OnChange event to often. This is now fixed. Bug discovered by
//      Andrius Adamonis (andrius@prototechnika.lt).
//      Added mtfSkipRest save flag which if set will ONLY write out the fields specified by the rest of
//      the flags, while default operation is to put a marker to indicate a field skipped.
//      Usually mtfSkipRest shouldnt be specified if the stream should be reloaded by LoadFromStream later on.
//      But for generating Excel CSV files or other stuff which doesnt need to be reloaded,
//      mtfSkipRest can be valuable.
//      Greatly speeded up LoadFromStream (GetLine and GetWord).
//
//1.17  Supporting fieldtypes ftFixedChar,ftWideString.
//      Added runtime fieldtype checking for catching unsupported fields.
//      Raymond J. Schappe (rschappe@isthmus-ts.com) found a bug in CompareFields which he send a fix for.
//      Added a read only Version property.
//      The faster LoadFromStream added in 1.12 has now been removed due to the optimization of
//      the original LoadFromStream in 1.16. Tests shows no noticably performance difference anymore.
//      Inspired by Bruno Depero (bdepero@usa.net) which send me some methods for saving and
//      loading table definitions, I added mtfSaveDef to TkbmMemTableSaveFlag. If used the table
//      definition will be saved in a file. To copy another datasets definition, first do a CreateTableAs,
//      then SaveToFile/SaveToStream with mtfSaveDef.
//      Renamed TkbmSupportedFieldTypes to kbmSupportedFieldTypes and TkbmBlobTypes to kbmBlobTypes.
//      Generalized Delphi/BCB definitions.
//      Denis Tsyplakov (den@vrn.sterling.ru) suggested two new events: OnLoadField and OnLoadRecord
//      which have been implemented.
//      Added OnCompressSave and OnDecompressLoad for user defined (de)compression of SaveToStream,
//      LoadFromStream, SaveToFile and LoadFromFile.
//      Bruno Depero (bdepero@usa.net) inspired me to do this, since he send me a version including
//      Zip compression. But I like to generalize things and not to depend on any other specific
//      3. part library. Now its up to you which compression to use.
//      Added OnCompressBlobStream and OnDecompressBlobStream for (de)compression of inmemory blobs.
//      Added LZH compression to the Demo project by Bruno Depero (bdepero@usa.net).
//
//1.18  Changed SaveToStream and LoadFromStream to code special characters in string fields
//      (ftString,ftWideString,ftFixedChar,ftMemo,ftFmtMemo).
//      You may change this behaviour to the old way by setting kbmStringTypes to an empty set.
//      Fixed severe blob null bug. Blobs fields was sometimes reported IsNull=true even if
//      they had data in them.
//      Fixed a few minor bugs.
//
//1.19  Fixed a bug in CodedStringToString where SetLength was to long.             (10. Aug. 1999)
//      Bug reported by Del Piero (tomli@mail.tycoon.com.tw).
//      Fixed bug in LoadFromStream where DuringTableDef was wrongly initialized
//      to true. Should be false. Showed when a CSV file without definition was loaded.
//      Bug reported by Mr. Schmidt (ISAT.Schmidt@t-online.de)
//
//1.20  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez (mroberto@jaca.cetuc.puc-rio.br) reported a few bugs(23. Aug. 1999)
//      to do with empty dataset, which he also corrected (GetRecNo, FilterMasterDetail).
//      Furthermore he suggested and provided code for a Capacity property, which
//      can be used to preallocate room in the internal recordlist for a specific
//      minimum number of records.
//      Explicitly typecasted @ to PChar in several places to avoid problem about
//      people checking 'Typed @' in compile options.
//
//1.21  Corrected Locate on filtered recordssets.                                   (24. Aug. 1999)
//      Problem observed by Keith Blows (keithblo@woollyware.com)
//
//1.22  Corrected GetActiveRecord and added overridden SetBlockReadSize to be       (30. Aug. 1999)
//      compatible with D4/BCB4's TProvider functionality. The information and
//      code has been generously supplied by Jason Wharton (jwharton@ibobjects.com).
//      Paul Moorcroft (pmoor@netspace.net.au) added SaveToBinaryFile, LoadFromBinaryFile,
//      SaveToBinaryStream and LoadFromBinaryStream. They save/load the contents incl.
//      structure to/from the stream/file in a binary form which saves space and is
//      faster.
//      Added support for ftLargeInt (D4/D5/BCB4).
//
//1.23  Forgot to add defines regarding Delphi 5. I havnt got D5 yet, and thus      (12. Sep. 1999)
//      not tested this myself, but have relied on another person telling me that it
//      do work in D5. Let me know if it doesnt.
//      Added save flag mtfSaveFiltered to allow saving all records regardless if they are
//      filtered or not. Suggestion posed by Jose Mauro Teixeira Marinho (marinho@aquarius.ime.eb.br)
//      Added automatic resort when records are inserted/edited into a sorted table by
//      Jirí Hostinský (tes@pce.cz). The autosort is controlled by AutoSort flag which is
//      disabled by default. Furthermore at least one SortField must be defined for the auto
//      sort to be active.
//
//1.24  The D5 story is continuing. Removed the override keyword on BCDToCurr        (7. Oct. 1999)
//      and CurrToBCD for D5 only. Changed type of PersistentFile from String to TFileName.
//      Support for SetKey, GotoKey, FindKey inspired by sourcecode from Azuer (blue@nexmil.net) for
//      TkbmMemTable v. 1.09, but now utilizing the new internal search features.
//      Fixed bug with master/detail introduced in 1.21 or so.
//      Fixed old bug in GetRecNo which didnt know how to end a count on a filtered recordset.
//      Support for SetRange, SetRangeStart, SetRangeEnd, ApplyRange, CancelRange,
//      EditRangeStart, EditRangeEnd, FindNearest, EditKey.
//      Fixed several bugs to do with date, time and datetime fields. Now the internal
//      storage format is a TDateTimeRec.
//      Fixed problems when saving a CSV file on one machine and loading it on another
//      with different national setup. Now the following layout is allways used on
//      save and load (unless the flag mtfSaveInLocalFormat is specified on the SaveToStream/SaveToFile method,
//      in which case the local national setup is used for save. Beware that the fileformat will not be
//      portable between machines, but can be used for simply creating a Comma separated report for other
//      use):  DateSeparator:='/'  TimeSeparator:=':'  ThousandSeparator:=','  DecimalSeparator:='.'
//      ShortDateFormat:='dd/mm/yyyy' CurrencyString:='' CurrencyFormat:=0 NegCurrFormat:=1
//      Date problems reported by Craig Murphy (craig@isleofjura.demon.co.uk).
//      We are getting close to have a very complete component now !!!
//
//1.25  Added CompareBookmarks, BookmarkValid, InternalBookmarkValid by             (11. Oct. 1999)
//      Lars Søndergaard (ls@lunatronic.dk)
//
//1.26  In 1.24 I introduced a new keybuffer principle for performance and easyness.(14. Oct. 1999)
//      Unfortunately I forgot a few things to do with Master/Detail. They have now
//      been fixed. Problem reported by Dirk Carstensen (D.Carstensen@FH-Wolfenbuettel.DE)
//      He also translated all string ressources to German.
//      Simply define the localization type wanted further down and recompile TkbmMemTable.
//      Fixed AutoSort problem when AutoSort=true on first record insert.
//      Further more setting AutoSort=true on a nonsorted dataset will Result in an
//      automatic full sort on table open.
//      Problem reported by Carl (petrolia@inforamp.net)
//      Added events OnSave and OnLoad which are called by SaveToDataSet,
//      SaveToStream, SaveToBinaryStream, SaveToFile, SaveToBinaryFile,
//      LoadFromDataSet, LoadFromStream, LoadFromBinaryStream,
//      LoadFromFile, LoadFromBinaryFile. StorageType defines what type of save/load
//      is going on: mtstDataSet, mtstStream, mtstBinaryStream, mtstFile and mtstBinaryFile.
//      Stream specifies the stream used to save/load. Will be nil if StorageType is mtstDataSet.
//
//1.27  In 1.26 I unfortunately made 2 errors... Forgot to rename the german ressource file's (19. Oct. 1999)
//      unitname and made another autosort problem. Things are going a bit fast at the moment,
//      thus it is up to you all to test my changes :)
//      Well..well... the german ressourcefile's unitname is now correct.
//      AutoSort is now working as it should. Been checking it :)
//      And its pretty fast too. Tried with 100.000 records, almost immediately
//      on a PII 500Mhz.
//      Added autosort facilities to the demo project and posibility to change
//      number of records in sample data. Tried with 1 million records... and it works :)
//      although quicksort is not the optimal algorithm to use on a very unbalanced
//      large recordset. It seems to be fast enough for around 10.000 records.
//      (almost immediately on a PII 500Mhz.)
//      Published SortOptions, and added SortDefault to do a sort using the published
//      sortfields and options. Mind you that Sort(...) sets up new sortoptions.
//
//1.28  Added PersistentSaveOptions.                                                 (21. Oct. 1999)
//      Added PersistentSaveFormat either mtsfBinary or mtsfCSV.
//      Fixed some flaws regarding persistense in designmode which could lead to loss of
//      data in the persistent file and loss of field definitions.
//
//1.29  I. M. M. VATOPEDIOU (monh@vatopedi.thessal.singular.gr) found a bug in GetRecNo (22. Oct. 1999)
//      which he send a fix for.
//
//1.30  Fernando (tolentino@atalaia.com.br) send OldValue enhancements and thus introduced
//      InternalInsert, InternalEdit, InternalCancel procedures.
//      Furthermore he suggested to rename TkbmMemTable to TkbmCustomMemTable and descend TkbmMemTable from it.
//      I decided to follow his suggestion as to make it easier to design own memory table children.
//      Kanca (kanca@ibm.net) send me example on runtime creation of TkbmMemTable. The example
//      has been put in the demo project as a comment.
//      Holger Dors (dors@kittelberger.de) suggested a version of CompareBookmarks which guarantiees
//      values -1, 0 or 1 as Result. This has now been implemented.
//      Furthermore he retranslated an incorrect German translation for FindNearest.
//
//1.31  SetRecNo and GetRecNo has been analyzed carefully and rewritten to      (26. Oct. 1999)
//      reflect normal behaviour. Locate was broken in 1.29 because of the prev.
//      GetRecNo fix. Reported by Carl (petrolia@inforamp.net).
//      There have been significant speedups in insert record and delete record.
//      Now TkbmMemTable contains a componenteditor for D5. Source has been donated by
//      Albert Research (albertrs@redestb.es) and partly changed by me.
//      Ressourcestrings has been translated to French by John Knipper (knipjo@altavista.net)
//      Removed InternalInsert for D3. Problem reported by John Knipper.
//
//1.32  Fernando (tolentino@atalaia.com.br) sent Portuguese/Brasillian translation. (5. Nov. 1999)
//      Vasil (vasils@ru.ru) sent Russian translation.
//      Javier Tari Agullo (jtari@cyber.es) sent Spanish translation.
//      Tero Tilus (terotil@cc.jyu.fi) suggested to save the visibility flag of a field too
//      along with all the other fielddefinitions in the SaveToStream/LoadFromStream etc. methods.
//      I changed CreateTableAs format to:
//        procedure CreateTableAs(Source:TDataSet; CopyOptions:TkbmMemTableCopyTableOptions);
//      where copyoptions can be:
//        mtcpoStructure         - Copy structure from the source datasource.
//        mtcpoOnlyActiveFields  - Only copy structure of active fields in the source datasource.
//        mtcpoProperties        - Also copy field info like DisplayName etc. from the source datasource.
//        mtcpoLookup            - Also copy lookup definitions from the source datasource.
//        mtcpoCalculated        - Also copy calculated fielddefinitions from the source datasource.
//      or a combination of those values in square brackets [...].
//      Further LoadFromDataSet is now following the same syntax.
//      A new method CreateFieldAs has been appended used by CreateTableAs.
//      Lookup fields defined in the memorytable now works as expected.
//      Now the designer will show all types of database tables, not only STANDARD.
//      Changed CopyRecords to allow copying of calculated data, and not clearing out
//      lookup fields on destination.
//      Fixed autosort error reported by Walter Yu (walteryu@21cn.com).
//
//1.33  Fixed error in CopyRecords which would lead to wrongly clearing calculated fields  (23. Nov. 1999)
//      after they have correcly been set.
//      Fixed problem with autosort when inserting record before first.
//      Fixed exception problem with masterfields property during load. Problem
//      reported by Jose Luis Tirado (jltirado@jazzfree.com).
//      Fixed a few errors in the demo application.
//      Added Italian translation by Bruno Depero (bdepero@usa.net).
//
//1.34  Fixed Resort problem not setting FSorted=true. Problem reported by     (3. Dec. 1999)
//      Tim_Daborn@Compuserve.com.
//      Added Slovakian translation by Roman Olexa (systech@ba.telecom.sk)
//      Added Romanian translation by Sorin Pohontu (spohontu@assist.cccis.ro)
//      Fixed problem about FSortFieldList not being updated when new sortfields are defined.
//      The fix solves the AutoSort problem reported by Sorin Pohontu (spohontu@assist.cccis.ro)
//      Javier Tari Agullo (jtari@cyber.es) send a fix for Spanish translation.
//      Added threaded dataset controller (TkbmThreadDataSet).
//      Put it on a form, link the dataset property to a dataset.
//      When you need to use a dataset, do:
//
//      ds:=ThreadDataset.Lock;
//      try
//         ...
//      finally
//         ThreadDataset.Unlock;
//      end;
//
//1.35  LargeInt type handling changed. Now it will be read and saved          21. Dec. 1999
//      as a float, not as an integer. General fixes to do with LargeInt field
//      types. Bug reported by Fernando P. Nájera Cano (j.najera@cgac.es).
//      Fixed bug reported by Urs Wagner (Urs_Wagner%NEUE_BANKENSOFTWARE_AG@raiffeisen.ch)
//      where a field could be edited even if no Edit or Insert statement has been issued.
//      Jozef Bielik (jozef@gates96.com) suggested to reset FRecNo and FSorted when
//      last record is deleted in _InternalDelete. This has been implemented.
//
//1.36  Edison Mera Menéndez (edmera@yahoo.com) send fix for bug in autoupdate. 23. Dec. 1999
//      Further he send code for a faster resort based on binary search for
//      insertionpoint instead of the rather sequential one in the previous version.
//      In case of problems, the old code can be activated by defining ORIGINAL_RESORT
//      He also suggested and send code for an unified _InternalSearch which does the
//      job of selecting either sequential or binary search.
//      Brad - RightClick (brade@rightclick.com.au) suggested that autosort should be
//      disengaged during load operations. I agree and thus have implemented it.
//      Implemented that EmptyTable implecitely does a cancel in case the table
//      was in Edit mode. Suggested by Albert Research (albertrs@redestb.es).
//
//1.37  Claude Rieth from Computer Team sarl (clrieth@team.lu) suggested to be able to 3. Jan. 2000
//      specify save options for CommaText. Thus CommaTextOptions has been added.
//      Several people have been having trouble installing in BCB4. The reason is
//      that some unused 3.rd party libraries sneeked into the TkbmMemTable
//      BCB4 project file. It has been fixed.
//      Bookmark handling has been corrected. Problem reported by Dick Boogaers (d.boogaers@css.nl).
//      InternalLoadFromBinaryStream has been fixed with regards to loading a NULL date.
//      A date is considered NULL when the value of the date is 0.0 (1/1/1899).
//      Problem reported by Paul Moorcroft (pmoor@netspace.net.au)
//      Ohh.. and HAPPY NEWYEAR everybody! The world didnt vanish because of 2 digits.
//      Isnt that NICE !! :)
//
//2.00a BETA First beta release.
//      CompareBookmark corrected to handle nil bookmark pointers by             5. Jan. 2000
//      jozef bielik (jozef@gates96.com)
//      Indexes introduced. AddIndex,DeleteIndex,IndexDefs supported.
//      AutoSort removed, Resort removed, Sort and SortOn now emulated via an internal index
//      named __MT__DEFSORT__.
//      Indexes introduced as a way into the internal indexes. Not really needed by most.
//      EnableIndexes can be set to false to avoid updating the indexes during a heavy load
//      operation f.ex. The indexes will be invalid until next UpdateIndexes is issued.
//      mtfSaveIndexDef added to possible save flags.
//      Save formats changed for both CSV files and binary files. For reading v.1.xx
//      files, either use CSV format or for binary files, set the compatibility
//      definition further down. V. 1.xx will NOT be compatible with files written
//      in v.2.xx format unless no table definitions are written.
//      _InternalSearch, _InternalBinarySearch and _InternalSequentialSearch removed.
//      ftBytes fieldtype corrected. Usage is shown in the demo project.
//
//2.00b BETA Fixed D4 installation problem reported by Edison Mera Menéndez (edmera@yahoo.com).
//      Published IndexDefs.
//      Added support for ixUnique.
//      Thomas Everth (everth@wave.co.nz) fixed two minor issues in LoadFromDataSet and
//      SaveToDataSet. Further he provided the protected method UpdateRecords, and the
//      public method UpdateToDataset which can be used to sync. another dataset with
//      the contents of the memorytable.
//      Fixed lookup to correcly handle null or empty keyvalues.
//
//2.00c BETA Renamed IndexFields to IndexFieldNames. Supporting IndexName.
//      Fixed designtime indexdefinitions wouldnt be activated at runtime.
//      Fixed Sort/SortOn would generate exception. Fixed Sort/SortOn on blob
//      would generate exception.
//
//2.00d BETA Fixed Master/Detail.
//      Changed the internal FRecords TList to a double linked list to make
//      deletes alot easier from the list. FRecords have been superseeded by
//      FFirstRecord and FFLastRecord. Changed the recordstructure. Introduced
//      TkbmRecord and PkbmRecord which is the definition of a record item.
//      Fixed SwitchToIndex to maintain current record the same after a switch.
//      Added notification handling to reflect removal of other components.
//      Added support for borrowing structures from another TDataset in the
//      table designer.
//
//2.00e BETA Changed bookmark functionality.
//      Fixed D4 installation.
//      Fixed index updating.
//      Optimized indexing and bookmark performance.
//      Added record validity check.
//      Still some bookmark problems.
//
//2.00f BETA Removed the double linked list idea from 2.00d. Back to a TList.
//      Reason is the bookmark handling is not easy to get to work with pointers,
//      plus its needed to be able to delete a record without actually removing
//      it from the 'physical' database. Thus PackTable has been introduced.
//      Deleting a record actually frees the recordcontents, but the spot in
//      the TList will not be deleted, just marked as deleted (nil). PackTable removes
//      all those empty spots, but at the same time invalidates bookmarks.
//      EmptyTable does what the name says, empty it including empty spots and
//      records as allways. Result should be that bookmarks are working as they
//      should, and GotoBookmark is very fast now.
//      Empty spots will automatically be reused when inserting new records
//      by the use of a list of deleted recordID's, FDeletedRecords.
//      Protected function LocateRecord changed.
//      Locate changed, Lookup behaviour improved.
//      CancelRange behaviour improved.
//
//2.00g BETA Fixed edit error when only 1 record was left and indexes defined.
//      Problem reported by Dick Boogaers (d.boogaers@css.nl).
//      Fixed error occuring when inserting records in an empty memtable with
//      a unique index defined.
//      Fixed error when altering a field which is indexed to a value bigger than
//      biggest value for that field in the table.
//
//2.00h BETA Added IndexFields property as suggested by Dick Boogaers (d.boogaers@css.nl).
//
//2.00i BETA Added AttachedTo property for having two or more views on the
//      physical same data. Updating one table will show immediately in the others.
//      Fielddefinitions will be inherited from the primary table holding the data.
//      There can only be one level of attachments. Eg. t2 can be attached to t1,
//      but then t3 can't be attached at t2, but must be directly attached to t1.
//      Its possible to have different indexes on the tables sharing same data.
//      Fixed SearchRecordID problem which sometimes didnt find the record even
//      if it definitely existed. The reason and solution is explained in the
//      SearchRecordID method.
//      Made TkbmCustomMemTable threadsafe.
//      ftArray and ftADT support added by Stas Antonov (hcat@hypersoft.ru).
//
//2.00j BETA Changed to not check for disabled controls on DisableControls/EnableControls
//      pairs. Fixed wrong call to _InternalEmpty in InternalClose when an attached
//      table close. Thread locking changed and fixed.
//      New property AttachedAutoRefresh. Set to false to disallow the cascading refreshes
//      on dataaware controls connected to all the attached memorytables.
//
//2.00k BETA Made public properties on TkbmIndex:
//      IsOrdered:boolead It can be used to determine if the index is up to date.
//      Or it can be set to true to force that the index must be percieved as up to date,
//      even if it hasnt been fully resorted since creation. Usefull f.ex. when loading
//      data from a presorted file. Eg.:
//      mt.EnableIndexes:=false;
//      mt.LoadFromFile(...);
//      mt.EnableIndexes:=true;
//
//      // Since the data was saved using the index named 'iSomeIndex' and thus loaded
//      // in the right sortorder, dont reupdate the iSomeIndex index.
//      mt.Indexes.Get('iSomeIndex').IsOrdered:=true;
//
//      // At some point, update all nonordered indexes.
//      mt.UpdateIndexes;
//
//      IndexType:TkbmIndexType Should only be used to determine the indextype. Dont set.
//      CompareOptions:TkbmMemTableCompareOptions Should only be used to determine the compare options.
//      Dont set.
//      IndexOptions:TIndexOptions Should only be used to determine the indexoptions. Dont set.
//      IndexFields:string Should only be used to determine the fields in the index. Dont set.
//      IndexFieldList:TList Should only be used to gain access to a list of TField objects
//      of fields participating in the index. Dont alter or set.
//      Dataset:TkbmCustomMemTable Should only be used to determine the dataset on which the
//      index is created. Dont set.
//      Name:string Should only be used to determine the name used during creation of the index.
//      Dont set.
//      References:TList References to the records. The references are sorted in the way the index defines.
//      IsRowOrder:boolean Used to determine if this index is a row order index. (the order the records
//      are inserted).
//      IsInternal:boolean Used to determine if this index is an internal index (used by SortOn f.ex.)
//      IndexOfs:integer Used to determine what position this index have in the TkbmIndexes list.
//      Fixed ftBytes bug reported by Gianluca Bonfatti (gbonfatti@libero.it).
//
//2.01  FINAL Cosmin (monh@vatopedi.thessal.singular.gr) reported some problems
//      and came up with some fixes. I have loosely followed them to solve the problems.
//      a) Fixed loading data into readonly fields using LoadFrom...
//      Developers can use new 'IgnoreReadOnly' public property if they want to
//      update fields which are actually defined as readonly. Remember to
//      set it to false again to avoid users updating readonly fields.
//      b) Fixed readonly on table level.
//      c) New read only property: RangeActive:boolean. True if a range is set.
//      d) Fixed autoinc. fields.
//      Fixed bogus warning about undefined return from SearchRecordID.
//
//2.01a Fixed wrong use of FBufferSize in PrepareKeyRecord. Should be FRecordSize;
//
//2.10  Now complete support for Filter property!
//
//2.11  The filter property is only supported for D5. IFDEF's inserted to maintain
//      backwards compatibility.
//      Support for a UniqueRecordID which allways will increase on each insert
//      in contrast to RecordID which is not unique through the lifetime of
//      a memorytable (eg. reusing deleted record spots).
//      Support for RecordTag (longint) which can be used by any application to fill
//      extra info into the record for own use without having to create a real
//      field for that information. Remember that the application is responsible
//      for freeing memory pointed to by this tag (if thats the way its used).
//      Added mtfSaveIgnoreRange and mtfSaveIgnoreMasterDetail to solve problem reported
//      by monh@vatopedi.thessal.singular.gr that saving data during master/detail
//      or ranges will only save 'visible' records.
//
//2.20  NOTE!!!!!   !!!!   !!!!!  NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT  !!!! PLEASE READ !!!!!
//      Fixed quite serious bug in PrepareKeyRecord which would overwrite    16. Feb. 2000
//      memory. Problem occured after using one of the SetKey, EditKey, FindKey,
//      GotoKey, FindNearest methods.
//      Enhanced record validation scheme. Can now check for memory overruns.
//      Changed the inner workings of FindKey and FindNearest a little bit.
//      Fixed that if an IndexDef was specified without any fields, an exception will
//      be raised.
//      Added CopyBlob boolean flag to _InternalCopyRecord which if set, also
//      duplicates all blobs in the copy. Remember to _InternalFreeRecord with
//      the FreeBlob boolean flag set for these copies.
//      Added journaling functionality through the new properties
//      Journal:TkbmJournal, EnableJournal:boolean, IsJournaling:boolean and
//      IsJournalAvailable:boolean. The journaling features are inspired by
//      CARIOTOGLOU MIKE (Mike@singular.gr).
//
//2.21  Fixed backward compatibility with Delphi 3.
//
//2.22  Fixed Sort and SortOn problem with CancelRange.
//      Fixed compile problem when defining BINARY_FILE_1_COMPATIBILITY.
//
//2.23  Fixed several bugs in TkbmCustomMemTable.UpdateIndexes which would
//      lead to duplicate indexdefinitions on every update, which again would
//      lead to the infamous idelete<0 bug.
//      Inserted several checks for table being active in situations where
//      indexes are modified.
//
//2.24  Fixed bug reported by Jean-Pierre LIENARD (jplienard@compuserve.com)
//      where Sort/SortOn called 2 times around a close/open pair would lead
//      to AV. InternalClose now deletes a sortindex if one where created.
//      Thus Sort/SortOn are only temporary (as they were supposed to be in
//      the first place anyway :)
//      Fixed small filtering bug.
//
//2.30a ALPHA Fixed bug in BinarySearch. Before it correctly found a matching record
//      but it was not guranteed the first available record matching. Now it
//      backtracks to make sure its the first one in the sortorder which matchs.
//      Fixed old problem when persistent tables are not written on destruction
//      of the component.
//      Fixed GetByFieldNames (use to find an index based on fieldnames) to be
//      case insensitive.
//      Journal is now freed on close of table, not destruction.
//      Fixed bug in _InternalCompareRecords which would compare with one field
//      to little if maxfields were specified (noticed in some cases in M/D
//      setups).
//      Changed internals of _InternalSaveToStream and _InternalSaveToBinaryStream.
//      Support for versioning implemented. Support for saving deltas using
//      SaveToBinary... supported using flag mtfSaveDeltas.
//      Resolver class (TkbmCustomDeltaHandler) for descending from to
//      make delta resolvers.
//      Added StartTransaction, Commit, Rollback as virtual methods for local
//      transaction handling. Override these to handle middleware transactions.
//      Added readonly TransactionLevel which shows the level of the current
//      transaction.
//      CARIOTOGLOU MIKE (Mike@singular.gr) came up with a big part of the versioning code
//      and had several suggestions to how to handle deltas and versioning.
//
//2.30b BETA Added checking for empty record in list of records in several places (lst.items[n]=nil)
//      Added new save flag mtfSaveDontFilterDeltas which if not specified, filters out
//      all records which has been inserted and then deleted again within the same session.
//      (A session understood like from load of records to save of them).
//      Added new property AllData which can be read to get a variant containing all data
//      and be set from a variant to load all data from.
//      Added new property AllDataOptions which defines which data will be saved using the
//      AllData property. Suggested by CARIOTOGLOU MIKE (Mike@singular.gr).
//      Added designtime persistense of data on form by the new property StoreDataOnForm.
//      If a designtime memtable contains data and thus is active, setting StoreDataOnForm:=true
//      and saving the form will save the data on the form. Thus the data will be available
//      when the form is loaded next time aslong the memtable is active (opened).
//      Added Czech translation by Roman Krejci (info@rksolution.cz)
//      Added property IsFieldModified(i:integer):boolean for checking if a field has been modified.
//      The status is only available until Cancel or Post. Suggested by Alexandre DANVY (alex-dan@ebp.fr)
//      Tabledesigner layout fixed.
//
//2.30c BETA Added two generaly available procedures:                        3. Mar. 2000
//      StreamToVariant and VariantToStream which handles putting a stream into
//      a variant and extracting it again. Means its possible to store f.ex a complete
//      file in a variant by opening the file with a TFileStream and pass the stream
//      through StreamToVariant.
//      Added example of transactioning to the demo project.
//      Added support for TField.DefaultExpression (default value for each field).
//      Define DO_CHECKRECORD to call _InternalCheckRecord. Was default before.
//      Normally only to be used in debug situations.
//      Applied some performance optimizations.
//
//2.30  FINAL Fixed before close bug which would clear a persistent file
//      if the programmer called close before destroy. Problem reported by
//      Frans Bouwmans (fbouwmans@spiditel.nl)
//      Fixed clear index bug not resetting FSortIndex. Problem reported by
//      Ronald Eckersberger (TeamDM) (ron@input.at)
//      Published AutoCalcFields.
//      Added property: RecalcOnFetch (default true) which regulates if
//      calculated fields should be recalced on each fetch of a record or not.
//      Fixed resetting AttachedTo when parent table is destroyed.
//
//2.31  Fixed D3 compatibility.
//      Fixed Resolver. OrigValues as record at checkpoint, Values as
//      record in current version.
//      Fixed missing resync in FindNearest reported by
//      Alexander V. Miloserdov (tatco@cherkiz.spb.su).
//
//2.32  Fixed TkbmCustomMemTable.DeleteIndex A/V bug in D4. Problem reported
//      by Alexander V. Miloserdov (tatco@cherkiz.spb.su).
//
//2.33  Refixed again FindNearest. This time it works ;)
//
//2.34  Fixed missing filter in SaveTo.... Problem reported by Alexei Smirnov (alexeisu@kupol.ru)
//      Fixed missing use of binary search. Problem reported by Tim Daborn (Tim_Daborn@Compuserve.com)
//      Data persistency on destruction of component fixed. Fix by Cosmin (monh@vatopedi.thessal.singular.gr)
//      UpdateRecord fixed with regards to only one key field specified.
//      Fix by Marcello Tavares (TAVARES@emicol.com.br)
//      Brazilian ressource file changed by Marcello Tavares (TAVARES@emicol.com.br).
//      Added KBM_MAX_FIELDS which can be changed to set max. number of fields
//      to handle in a table. Default 256.
//      Fixed bug in error message when unsupported field added to fielddef.
//      Problem reported by Alexandre Danvy (alex-dan@ebp.fr)
//      Fixed some bugs regarding SetRangeStart/End EditRangeStart/End and ApplyRange.
//      Remember to set IndexFieldNames to an index to use including the fields used for the range.
//      Better is to use a filter or similar.
//
//2.35  Fixed bug not clearing out indexes on table close.
//
//2.36  Fixed bug in DeleteIndex which would not reset FCurIndex correctly.   30. mar. 2000
//      Problem seen when SortOn or Sort would be called many times.
//      Problem reported by Michail Haralampos (Space Systems) (spacesys@otenet.gr)
//      Changed CreateTableAs to not to update fielddefs while source table is allready
//      active for compatibility with a bug in Direct Oracle Access. Problem
//      reported by Holger Dors (dors@kittelberger.de)
//      Changed handling of oldrecord and current record during an edit of a record to
//      correctly cancel changes to a blob. Problem reported by Ludek Horcicka (ludek.horcicka@bcbrno.cz)
//
//2.37  Fixed A/V bug versioning blobfields. Problem reported by Jerzy Labocha (jurekl@geocities.com).
//      Optimized indexing when record edited which does not affect index.
//      Suggested by Lou Fernandez (lfernandez@horizongt.com).
//      Fixed bug in InternalLoadFromBinary where check for ixNonMaintained was in wrong order
//      compared to savetobinary.
//      Fixed bug in InternalLoadFromBinary where indexes was created and marked
//      as updated prematurely. Problem reported by Jerzy Labocha (jurekl@geocities.com).
//      Changed LoadFromDataSet to allow copy of properties from default fields.
//      Problem reported by Tim Evans (time@cix.compulink.co.uk).
//
//2.38  Fixed bug not correctly determining autoinc value on loading binary file.
//      Problem and fix reported by Jerzy Labocha (jurekl@geocities.com).
//      Fixed small bug in SaveToStream where nil records would risc being saved.
//      Fixed bug in SetRecNo reported by Mike Cariotoglou (Mike@singular.gr).
//      Added RespectFilter on TkbmIndex.Search and TkbmIndexes.Search for Locate etc. to
//      respect filters set. Problem reported by Andrew Leiper (Andy@ietgroup.com).
//      Added to index search routines to make them threadsafe.
//      Fixed bug updating indexes of attached tables on edit of master table.
//      Problem reported by Lou Fernandez (lfernandez@horizongt.com).
//      Added CSV delimiter properties: CSVQuote, CSVFieldDelimiter, CSVRecordDelimiter
//      which are all char to define how CSV output or input should be handled.
//      CSVRecordDelimiter can be #0 to not insert a recorddelimiter. Note that
//      #13+#10 will be inserted at all times anyway to seperate records.
//      Fixed bug in _InternalClearRecord and added new protected method
//      UnmodifiedRecord in TkbmCustomDeltaHandler.
//      Changed algorithm of dsOldRecord to return first version of record.
//      Added 3 new public medium level functions:
//        function GetVersionFieldData(Field:TField; Version:integer):variant;
//        function GetVersionStatus(Version:integer):TUpdateStatus;
//        function GetVersionCount:integer;
//      which can be used to obtain info about previous versions of current record.
//      GetVersionCount get number of versions of current record. Min 1.
//      GetVersionFieldData gets a variant of data of a specific version. Current
//      record version (newest) is 0.
//      GetVersionStatus returns the TUpdateStatus info of a specific version. Current
//      record version (newest) is 0.
//      Inspiration and fixes by Mike Cariotoglou (Mike@singular.gr).
//
//2.39  Fixed bug setting Filtered while Filter is empty.
//      Fixed autoinc bug on attached tables reported by Jerzy Labocha (jurekl@geocities.com).
//      Added GetRows function for getting a specified number of rows at a starting point
//      and return them as a variant. Code contributed by Reinhard Kalinke (R_Kalinke@compuserve.com)
//      Added integer property LoadLimit which will limit the number of records loaded using LoadFrom....
//      methods. Suggested by Roman Olexa (systech@ba.telecom.sk). if LoadLimit<=0 then
//      no limit is imposed.
//      Added read only integer property LoadCount which specifies how many records
//      was affected in last load operation.
//      Added read only boolean property LoadedCompletely which is true if all data was loaded,
//      false if the load was interrupted because of LoadLimit.
//      Fixed LoadFrom.... to not load into non data fields. Fix by cosmin@lycosmail.com.
//      Fixed persistency on destruction of component.
//      Added partial Dutch ressourcefile by M.H. Avegaart (avegaart@mccomm.nl).
//      Added method Reset to clear out data, fields, indexes and more by kanca@ibm.net.
//      LoadFromBinaryStream/File now tries to guess approx. how many records will be loaded
//      and thus adjust capacity accordingly.
//      Improved persistent save to not delete original file before finished writing new.
//      Suggested by Paul Bailey (paul@cirrlus.co.za).
//      Fixed minor bug in GetRecordCount when table not active by Csehi Andras (acsehi@qsoft.hu)

//2.40  Fixed problem with SetRange specifying fewer fields than number of index fields, giving   12. May. 2000
//      wrong number of Resulting records. Problem reported by Jay Herrmann (Jayh@adamsbusinessforms.com)
//      Added new AddIndex2 method to TkbmCustomMemTable which allows to define some additional indexsetups:
//        mtcoIgnoreLocale   which use standard CompareStr instead of AnsiCompareStr.
//        mtcoIgnoreNullKey  which specifies that a null key field value will be ignored in record comparison.
//      Except for the ExtraOptions parameter its equal in functionality to AddIndex.
//      Added new property: OnCompareFields which can be used to handle specialized sortings and searches.
//      Made the following functions publicly available:
//           function CompareFields(KeyField,AField:pointer; FieldType: TFieldType; Partial, CaseInsensitive,IgnoreLocale:boolean):Integer;
//           function StringToCodedString(const Source:string):string;

//           function StringToBase64(const Source:string):string;
//           function Base64ToString(const Source:string):string;
//      Added new property: AutoIncMinValue which can be used to set startvalue for autoinc. field.
//      Added new property: AutoIncValue which can be used to obtain current next value for an autoinc field.
//
//2.41  Fixed problem regarding calculated fields on attached table not updating. Problem
//      reported by aZaZel (azazel@planningsrl.it).
//
//2.42  Added PersistentBackup:boolean and PersistentBackupExt:string which controls if to make  25. May. 2000
//      a backup of the previous persistent file and which extension the file should have.
//      Code provided by cosmin@lycosmail.com.

//      Problem reported by George Tasker (gtasker@informedsources.com.au)
//      Published BeforeRefresh and AfterRefresh.
//      Fixed deactivation of designed active table during runtime. Reason was missing inherited

//
//2.43  Added OnProgress event which will fire on long operations notifying how
//      many percent has been accomplished. The operation performed can be
//      found in the Code parameter.
//      Added new FastQuickSort procedure to TkbmIndex. Enhances searchspeed by
//      somewhere around 50-75%. Sorting 100.000 records on a field on a PII 450Mhz
//      now takes approx 5 secs. FastQuickSort (combination of a modified Quicksort and
//      Insertion sort) is now the default sorting mechanism.
//      To reenable the previous standard Quicksort mechanism, put a comment on the
//      USE_FAST_QUICKSORT definition further down.

//      Problem reported by Roman Olexa (systech@ba.telecom.sk).
//
//2.44  Removed stupid bug I implemented in 2.43. Forgot to remove some code.
//      Fixed the demo project handling range. The demo of the SetRange function
//      forgot that no index named 'Period' was defined, thus the range was set
//      on the currently active index instead.
//      Added support for using SortOn('',....) for selecting the roworder index.
//      Defined some consts for internal indexnames and internal journal field names.
//        kbmRowOrderIndex = '__MT__ROWORDER'
//        kbmDefSortIndex  = '__MT__DEFSORT'

//      Added several more progress functions.
//      Added TableState which can be polled to decide whats going on in the table at
//      the moment.
//      Added AutoReposition property (default false) which determines if automatically
//      to reposition to new place for record on record post, or to stay at current pos.
//      Fixed dupplicate fieldname problem with attached tables as reported by
//      Roman Olexa (systech@ba.telecom.sk). If fieldnames conflict between the
//      current table and the table attached to, the original current table field
//      is removed from the table, and the attached to table field used instead.
//
//2.45b Fixed missing FOrdered:=true on FastQuicksort. Problem reported

//      Fixed filtering of strings through the Filter property. Problem reported
//      by several.
//      Modified demoproject with FindKey functionality and string field.
//      For the time being, removed support for the WideString fieldtype.
//      Changed SaveToBinaryxxxxx to save in the order of the current index.
//      Beware that if the current index is not up to date, it could mean
//      saving less records than there actually is in the table.
//      Changed binary file format to include null value info. LoadFromBinaryxxx
//      is backwards compatible, but files saved with SaveToBinaryxxxx can only
//      be read by software incoorporating TkbmMemTable v. 2.49 or newer.
//      If needed, one of the BINARY_FILE_XXX_COMPATIBILITY defines can be

//      TkbmMemTable.
//
//2.50  Fixed bug on SortOn after UpdateIndexes. Problem reported by Gate (x_gate@hotmail.com)
// a-d  Added IndexByName(IndexName:string) property to obtain a TkbmIndex object for
// Beta the specified indexname.
//      Added Enabled property to TkbmIndex which can be set to false to disable
//      updating that index or true to allow updating again. An automatic rebuild
//      is issued if needed.
//      Fixed incorrect definition of properties EnableVersioning and VersioningMode
//      in TkbmMemTable. Problem reported by U. Classen (uc@dsa-ac.de)
//      Made CopyRecords public and changed it to copy from current pos in source.
//      Fixed counter bug in CopyRecords which would copy one record more than limit.
//      Fix suggested by Wilfried Mestdagh (wilfried_sonal@compuserve.com).
//      Added saveflag mtfSaveAppend which will append the current dataset to

//      Optimized per record memory usage by compiling out the debug values startident and endident
//      + made record allocation one call to getmem instead of two. Suggested by
//      Lluís Ollé (mailto:llob@menta.net)
//      Added Performance property which can hold mtpfFast, mtpfBalanced or mtpfSmall.
//      Meaning:
//        mtpfFast=One GetMem/Rec. No recordcompression.
//        mtpfBalanced=One or more GetMem/Rec. Null varlength fields are compressed.
//        mtpfSmall=Like mtpfBalanced except varlength field level compression is made.
//      Use mtpfFast if all string values will have a value which are close to the
//      max size of the string fields or raw speed is important.
//      Use mtpfBalanced if most string fields will be null.
//      Use mtpfSmall in other cases.
//      Added OnCompressField and OnDecompressField which can be used to
//      create ones own field level compression and decompression for all nonblob
//      varlength fields. For blobfields checkout OnCompressBlob and OnDecompressBlob.
//      Added OnSetupField which can be used to overwrite indirection of
//      specific fields when Performance is mtpfBalanced or mtpfSmall.
//      Fixed locate on date or time fields giving variant conversion error.

//      Since I cannot completely grasp the implications of the changed scheme,
//      I have included it to leave it up to you to test it. The old scheme
//      is commented out in SetAttachedTo.
//      Alex Wijoyo (alex_wijoyo@telkom.net) suggested changing CreateTableAs.
//      Instead of using FieldDefs.Assign.... then a routine of our own is used.
//      This to avoid complications he had using TkbmMemTable in a DLL.
//      ProviderFlags are now copied in CopyFieldProperties. Bug reported by

//      Solves bug when sequence Open table, Close table, LoadFrom.... didnt
//      update indexes correctly.
//      Added properties CSVTrueString and CSVFalseString for setting
//      stringrepresentation of true and false. Default value 'True' and 'False'.
//      Notice they are caxe sensitive.
//      Updated demo project to show OnProgress event.
//      Added new class TkbmSharedData for datasharing between memtables.
//      Modifed TkbmCustomMemtable to use this new class.
//      Added Standalone property which can be set to true for true standalone
//      memorytables that is tables that are not attaching to other table and other
//      tables dont attach to. The table is not threadsafe if Standalone=true.
//      It can gain a few percentage of speed.
//      Reintroduced Capacity property for prespecifying expected number of records.
//      Today i've tested inserting 1 million records of 1 string field with field

//      Changed the use of TCriticalSection to TRTLCriticalSection for non Level 5
//      compilers. Should make D3 compilation possible.
//      Changed SetEnabled of TkbmIndex to use a FEnabled field instead of ixNonMaintained.

//2.50i Major changes in shareddatarecord system. Rewritten to use TkbmCommon class. 4. Jan. 2001
// Beta Rewritten parts of VarLength and blob handling to fix several bugs
//      and leaks.
//      Changed so each attaced table has its own bookmark in the record.
//      Thus total recordsize is dependent on the number of tables attached
//      to it.
//      Implemented lots of fixes and memory optimizations.
//      Fixed and updated designer for loading of data from another TDataset
//      + several other bugs which could cause D5 to hang without posibility
//      to exit.
//      Implemented fix in GetLine by Primoz Gabrijelcic (gabr@17slon.com)
//      Fixed missing quoting of boolean field on save. Reported by Juergen (jschroth@gmx.de)
//      Added saveflag mtfSaveFieldKind. If specified together with mtfSaveDef,
//      the field kind will be restored when data is loaded again.
//      Thus fileformat is upgraded to 250, but should be backwards read
//      compatible.
//      Fixed autoreposition when no keys changed. Bug reported by Davy Anest (davy-ane@ebp.fr)
//      Renamed GetDeletedRecordsCount function to a property DeletedRecordsCount.
//      Journaling removed! Let me hear if that is a problem.
//      Implemented different BinarySearch algorithm long time ago suggested by
//      CARIOTOGLOU MIKE (Mike@singular.gr).
//      Fixed comparebookmarks to also compare on recordid.

//      ftWideString and ftGUID support during LoadFromDataset and CreateTableAs
//      as a normal ftString.
//      Fixed so autoinc is not populated during InternalLoadFromStream if the
//      field is in the data to load.
//      Changed so InternalLoadFromBinaryStream can load v. 1.xx files.
//      Solution suggested by Paul Moorcroft (pmoor@netspace.net.au)
//      Fixed SetRecNo to use GetRecNo instead of relying on FRecNo.
//      Fix suggested by Stefan Knecht (StefanKnecht@gmx.de)
//      Fixed bookmark error string in german ressource file by Stefan Knecht.
//      Added _REAL_ localization support through LocaleID, LanguageID, SubLanguageID
//      and SortID. In D5 LocaleID also presents a human readable list of
//      available locales. Setting LocaleID will autoupdate LanguageID, SubLanguageID
//      and SortID, and setting any of those will update LocaleID.
//      Made sure it could compile in D3! :)
//      Time to release and get on with my real work!                      7. Jan. 2001

//2.50n  Added Exists function to evaluate if the persistant file allready exists.
// Beta  Suggested by Tom Deprez (tom.deprez@village.uunet.be).
//       Added support for wildcard comparisons in filters by Yuri Tolsky (ut@tario.net)
//       Added support for BCD in filters for D5/BCB5 only by CARIOTOGLOU MIKE (Mike@singular.gr)
//       Removed BCDtoCurr and CurrToBCD from TkbmCustomMemTable since they were incorrect and
//       not used.
//
//2.50o  Fixed varlength bug in comparerecords. Bug reported by Jerzy Labocha (jurekl@ramzes.szczecin.pl)
//  Beta Fixed transaction handling. Bug reported by Radovan Antloga (radovan.antloga@siol.net)
//       Changed some Resync's to Refresh to better keep current record position.
//
//2.51   Fixed SetBlockReadSize which should only do next in D4 for fixing
// Beta  duplicate record bug in Midas for Delphi 4.00-4.03.
//       Added mtfSaveNoHeader to saveflags. If specified will not save field name header
//       line. Remember that LoadFromFile/Stream will _allways_ skip the first record in the
//       file/stream regardless of this flag. Thus mainly use mtfSaveNoHeader for appending
//       to an existing file or for other external use.
//       Added posibility to set CSVQuote to #0 to not use quotes for both save and load.
//       Be carefull not to have , in your field data and empty fields will allways
//       be interpreted as being null.
//       Now creating file if its not existing using mtfSaveAppend. Suggested by
//       Wilfried Mestdagh (wilfried_sonal@compuserve.com)
//       Fixed D4 compatibility to do with ftGUID.
//       Added support for saving/loading defaultexpression when saving field defs.
//       Fieldkind is now allways saved in the file if definitions are saved.
//       If mtfSaveFieldKind is not specified, it is saved as 'data' as fieldkind.
//       Binary file version is now 251, CSV file version is now 251.
//
//2.51b  Fixed allowing TDateTime and strings for PopulateField of date/time/datetime fields.
// Beta  Bug reported by Radovan Antloga (radovan.antloga@siol.net).
//       Fixed bug on persistent save when backup file exists by Naji Mouawad (naji@home.com)
//       Fixed GetRecNo when table is emptied.
//       Fixed missing index update when record is deleted and versioning is enabled.
//       Added filtered indexes. You can decide using a filter which records should be
//       part of an index when inserting and editing records. Check AddFilteredIndex function.
//       The filter doesnt have to be on the field(s) which are indexed.
//       Added OnFilterIndex event functioning like the OnFilterRecord except for indexes.
//       Fixed bug attaching on open table even if AttachMaxCount is set. Bug reported by
//       Andrew Leiper (Andy@ietgroup.com).
//       Refixed D4 ftGUID compile bug which should be fixed in 2.51 Beta.
//       Moved DisableControls in front of a try block as suggested by IMB (vatt@internet.gr)

//       delphi5 (delphi5@freemail.hu)
//
//2.52a  Fixed allowing also Double, Integer, Single to be used for argument for populatefield of
// Beta  date/time/datetime fields. Problem reported by Radovan Antloga (radovan.antloga@siol.net).
//       Changed InternalLoadFromStream to handle autoskipping fields which is not
//       present in either source file or table field definition.
//       Added posibility to specify index/sort/key options per field by using an enhanced
//       FieldNames syntax. The normal syntax is: fldname1;fldname2;fldname3...
//       The enhanced syntax allows adding a colon and some options to each of the fieldnames.
//       Eg: fldname1:C;fldname2:DC;fldname3
//       Which means fld specified with fldname1 should be case insensitive,
//       field specified with fldname2 should be descending and case insensitive,
//       and fldname3 should be ascending and case sensitive.
//       The following options are recognized:
//          C for Case insensitive,
//          D for Descending,
//          P for Partial,
//          N for ignore Nulls,
//          L for ignore Locale.
//       The changes was inspired by a descfields contribution from
//       Michael Bonner (michaelbonner@earthlink.net).
//       If SortOptions etc are specified, they overrule field specific settings.
//       Added backwards compability to IndexFieldNames in Master/Detail.
//       If DetailFields are not specified, but IndexFieldNames are, IndexFieldNames will be
//       used.
//       Fixed a few more compile bugs for pre LEVEL5 compilers.
//
//2.52b  Fixed bug using LoadFromStream to load a stream containing fewer fields than
// Beta  in memory table.

//       Problem reported by Martin Kreidenweis (80171@gmx.de)
//       Added protected method SetLoadedCompletely(AValue:boolean).
//       Improved threadsafeness. Remember that the VCL and dataaware
//       controls are _not_ threadsafe. To remedy this, in a thread
//       before any updates or access to the table do
//       mt.Lock;
//       try
//        ....
//       finally
//         mt.Unlock;

//       Added DesignActivation property (default true) which decides if
//       the table should be automatically activated at runtime if it was active
//       during save in designtime. Suggestion from Maurizio Lotauro (Lotauro.Maurizio@dnet.it).
//       Fixed so SaveToxxxx and UpdateToxxxx makes calls CheckBrowseMode to
//       ensure that the table is in browse mode, and not any edit/insert modes.
//       Bug reported by Maurizio Lotauro (Lotauro.Maurizio@dnet.it).
//
// 3.00a Moved FieldTypeNames and FieldKindNames to interface section for
// alpha compability with kbmMW.                                         22. July 2001
//       Removed wrong setting of FRecalcOnIndex in BuildFieldList.
//       Made BuildFieldList, FindFieldInList, IsFieldListsEqual and
//       SetFieldListOptions public.
//       Fixed A/V bug setting Deltahandler to nil.
//       Rearranged I/O scheme. Thus SaveToBinaryxxxx, LoadFromBinaryxxxx and
//       SaveToxxxx and LoadFromxxxx along with all the CSV save flags are
//       not available anymore. Instead two new components TkbmBinaryStreamFormat,
//       and TkbmCSVStreamFormat has been introduced. New formats for save and
//       load can be build by inheriting from TkbmCustomStreamFormat or
//       TkbmStreamFormat.
//       OnCompressBlobStream and OnDecompressBlobStream has an extra ADataset parameter.
//       This will require you to make a small change in your code for your event handler.
//       (De)Compression of load/save operations has now been moved to the TkbmCustomStreamFormat
//       components. Thus code for these events need to be moved.
//       Improved bookmarkvalid check by adding TkbmUserBookmark.
//
// 3.00b Added OnBeforeLoad, OnAfterLoad, OnBeforeSave and OnAfterSave to TkbmCustomStreamFormat.

//       the form is saved again to update the dfm file with the changed order.
//       Bug reported by Maurizio Lotauro (Lotauro.Maurizio@dnet.it).
//       Split the kbmMemStreamFormat.pas file into kbmMemCSVStreamFormat.pas and

//       All changes specific to those formats will be written in a history
//       in the start of each of the files.
//       Updated Slovakian ressource file by Roman Olexa (systech@ba.telecom.sk)

//       Added TestFilter method for applying a filter to the current
//       record to see if its matching the filter. Contributed by vatt@internet.gr.
//       Added sfSaveInsert flag to TkbmCustomStreamFormat which will save to a
//       stream at the current position. Other values are sfSaveAppend which will
//       append to the stream and none which will overwrite contents of stream.
//       sfAppend overrules sfInsert.
//       Added check for number of field defs in several places.
//       Updated some language ressource files.

//        Improved filtering to check for variant empty/null.
//        Added support for BCB6.
//        Added support for Kylix1. Please notice that the memtable designer although
//        ported for Linux, is not available simply because I cannot find a
//        decent way to invoke the default field editor programatically.
//        Thus all custom component editors have been disabled for Kylix 1.

//
// 3.01   30. June. 2002
//        Changed TkbmIndex constructor to accept TkbmMemTableCompareOptions instead of
//        TIndexOptions.
//        Added global public functions:
//        IndexOptions2CompareOptions and CompareOptions2IndexOptions for
//        easy conversion between the two sets.
//        This allows for Sort/SortOn/SortDefault to utilize all special memtable
//        compare options. Further it enables manually created indexes via
//        TkbmIndex to take advantage of those features too.
//        Problem indicated by mariusz@nizinski.net.
//        Added new property AutoUpdateFieldVariables which is false by default.
//        Setting it to true automatically updates/adds field variables to the

//        Added support for ftFmtBCD.
//        Fixed InternalOpen problem which recreated fields/fielddefs for attached tables.
//        This Resulted in severe problems when field order is different between base table
//        and attached table. Bug reported by michael.bonner@ci.fresno.ca.us.

//        Fixed bug with regards to loading widestring data in CSV streamformat.
//        Added sfDataTypeHeader to binary stream format which will allow storing
//        datatypes in the header. The information can be used to skip fields later on.
//        Notice that if this is used, it will break backward compatibility with older
//        binary files and with older versions of kbmMemTable.
//        Fixed repositioning problem after UpdateIndexes was run.
//        Fixed Kylix 3 compatibility.

//
// 5.00 beta 3  Dec. 1. 2004
//        Fixed several bugs related with dotNet port.
//        Added Delphi for dotNet demo app. Notice that there seems to be bugs
//        in some parts of the BDE for dotNet port and possibly some Delphi 2005.Net related
//        event bugs which can surface when copying from another dataset
//        (enablecontrols in LoadFromDataset). The exact circumstances are still being
//        investigated.
//        Further the icons still dont show up as expected. Will also be investigated further.
//        Finally WideString fields do not work as expected at the moment.
//
// 5.00 beta 4  Apr. 8. 2005
//        Fixed Locate when using a null value due to bug in PopulateField.
//        Fix by Carsten Schuette (carsten.schuette@ewetel.net)
//
// 5.00 RC1 Apr. 19. 2005
//        Upgrading to release candidate 1.
//
// 5.00 May 28. 2005
//        Modified AssignRecord not to use AsString but instead .Value.
//        Promoted CopyFieldProperties and CopyFieldsProperties to be public methods.
//
// 5.01 Aug 22. 2005

//        Fixed A/V in CheckpointRecord as reported by Henri Gourvest.
//        Fixed A/V after using EmptyTable as reported by several and fix suggested by
//           Vladimir Ulchenko.
//        Added GotoCurrent method.
//        Fixed not saving field invisible status in CSV format.
//        Fixed ftDate and ftTime fields size to be 4 bytes (longint) instead of 8
//           to solve A/V and data corruption problems. Borland use a partial
//           TDateTimeRec (half of it only) to store ftDate and ftTime values in
//           and since calculated fields use Borlands field size calculation,
//           we had to adjust kbmMemTable to adhere to same size.
//
// 5.02 Oct. 3. 2005
//        Fixed A/V in PopulateField for WideString field types. Fixes for example
//           filtering and locating on widestring fields. Problem reported by several.
//        Fixed Widestring fields in .Net.
//        Added GotoNearest method.
//        Fixed 'List out of bounds' when Rollback leaves no records.
//        Fixed implementing check for invalid values in calls to CurrToBCD.
//           Now the precision will at least be decimals after comma + 1 digit.
//        Fixed using ixCaseInsensitive and ixDescending in CreateIndex. Before
//           The wrong field lists where referenced. Now the current indexed field
//           list is used. Report by Carsten Schuette.
//
// 5.02b Oct. 7 2005
//        Fixed bug introduced in 5.02 regarding PopulateField and ftString which
//           mysteriously didnt show up in internal tests but which produced all
//           sorts of A/V's in true world apps. Reported by several.
//
// 5.50 Dec. 14 2005
//        Added support for BDS 2006 and 4 new fieldtypes:
//           ftFixedWideChar,ftWideMemo,ftOraTimeStamp,ftOraInterval
//        Fixed Notification when freeing instance that was created
//           as owned by another TComponent or container.

//
// 5.51 Dec. 30 2006
//        Fixed bug in CSV streamformat when used in D2006/Win32 due to
//           several TField properties changed to WideString.
//        Removed SetLength(s,0) as that could cause invalid pointer operation.
//        Fixed support for ftFixedWideChar and ftWideMemo for BDS2006.
//        Changed PopulateField for ftLargeInt to improve precision.
//
// 5.52 Feb. 23 2007
//        Fixed WideString support for BDS2006.
//        Fixed filter expressions for .Net (may still be issues in special cases. If so report them.)
//        Fixed respecting case when looking for appropriate index on searches.
//        Fixed using given search options when doing sequential search.
//        Fixed filtering on smallint field.
//        Changed commit not to drop older versions as that interfered with deltahandling.
//        Fixed not setting UpdateStatus on a record when its inserted for .Net.
//        Fixed marking fielddefs as internalcalc when they are based on an internalcalc field.
//        Fixed VariantToStream in .Net which truncated one byte affecting AllData.
